# GTK2
Collection of GTK2 software.

Unfortunately, in many distributions, it appears that even LXDE is compiled with GTK3 (e.g. Mageia 9, Debian Trixie+). Debian Bookworm and ALT Linux (Sysiphus, at least) are still with GTK2, but even there lxterminal is built with GTK3, which causes bad colors in ffmpeg. This project aims to correct the injustice.
